# Cushon - Eric Park

## Getting up and unning

Install the plugin from npm:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Overview

The app includes the following text as well as some engaging interactive features. Please take a moment to explore the app itself rather than focusing solely on this Readme file!

## Welcome

This component was created as part of the technical test for Cushon.
My goal was to showcase clean, modular code and demonstrate my
approach to problem-solving and best practices. I hope you find my
work clear and concise, and I look forward to hearing any feedback
you may have! Thank you again for setting aside your time—it’s truly
appreciated.

Given the open-ended nature of the task, I designed the component
with adaptability in mind. Recognizing the potential for its use in
multiple scenarios, I opted to:

- Utilize Feature Flags: This
  allows for controlled, conditional behavior, making it easy to
  enable or disable features as requirements evolve.
- Employ useContext: By
  centralizing logic in a React context, I aimed to provide a clean
  and maintainable way to manage state and share data between
  components.

While completing this component, there were a few things I would
have liked to achieve but didn’t have enough time for:

- E2E Testing with Storybook: I
  believe integrating Storybook for end-to-end testing would have
  significantly improved the component&apos;s robustness and
  maintainability.
- Expanded Test Coverage: While
  there are tests in place, I would have liked to increase coverage
  for edge cases and complex scenarios.
- Tailwind CSS Best Practices:
  This was my first experience working with Tailwind CSS, and while
  I made an effort to adhere to its conventions, I recognize there
  is more to learn about its best practices.

## Thank You
